# Covid19_Data_Analysis
This is a basic data visualization of the Covid19 pandemic. I have only plotted for data with respect to the world data and comparisons have been done for countries. It should be noted that notebook is not complete and I have a long way to go. Please click on the link to see the rendered view of my notebook. Thanks!

 # Covid19_Dashboard
 This dashboard was the final result of group project for the course R for Data Science. It was created by Sam Blum and myself. It      ultimately provide the end-user the ability to numerically and visually compare different states (or countriesâ€™), statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically by looking at cases, recoveries, deaths, and time since the first case was discovered. Additionally, with the visual graphs, the user has the ability to manipulate the data to account for log scales, moving averages, and adjusting for population (per-capita standardization) to create not only more universal, but customized comparison charts.
