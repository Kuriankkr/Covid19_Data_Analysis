# Covid 19 Dashboards

## Covid19_Data_Analysis using Jupyter

### Overivew
Before I decided to build a dashboard, I wanted to do some Exploratory Data Analysis with the pandemic data and see what are the insights that I could derive from that and also improve my visualization skills in python. Upon googling, I was introduced to new plotting libraries and data representation techniques that I believe I have incorporated in this notebook. The ipynb notebook has some interesting insights that I feel are important during the course of the pandemic.

**Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Kuriankkr/Covid19_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Covid_19%20Analysis.ipynb) to view the notebook**. The default github notebook viewer is not compatible all the visualizations that are present in the notebook

### Data to view the notebook 
The data has been sourced from [Covid-19 Data Repsitory by CSSE at John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The data has been analyzed from **Dec 2019 -- April 2020.** Three subsets of data were used from this repository
- [Confirmed Global Cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)
- [Confirmed Global Deaths](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv)
- [Confirmed Global Recovered Cases](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv)




This is a basic data visualization of the Covid19 pandemic. I have only plotted for data with respect to the world data and comparisons have been done for countries. It should be noted that notebook is not complete and I have a long way to go. Please click on the link to see the rendered view of my notebook. Thanks!


 
 # Covid19_Dashboard
 This dashboard was the final result of group project for the course R for Data Science. It was created by Sam Blum and myself. It      ultimately provide the end-user the ability to numerically and visually compare different states (or countriesâ€™), statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically by looking at cases, recoveries, deaths, and time since the first case was discovered. Additionally, with the visual graphs, the user has the ability to manipulate the data to account for log scales, moving averages, and adjusting for population (per-capita standardization) to create not only more universal, but customized comparison charts.
