# Covid 19 Dashboards

## Covid-19 Visualization using Tableu



## Covid-19 Visualization using R Shiny

### Overview 

This dashboard is the result of a course that I had taken in graduate school (Stat 5730). It was done in collaboration with [Sam Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-blum-988896158/). 

I took care of the backend of the project which involved shaping the data, creating the visualizations and calculating the different features that would be presented as options in the front end. Sam took care of the front end of the project where he dealt with how to organize the views for the end user, how the features should be presented and made sure that both the ends worked seamlessly without glitches.

### Overivew
Before I decided to build a dashboard, I wanted to do some Exploratory Data Analysis with the pandemic data and see what are the insights that I could derive from that and also improve my visualization skills in python. Upon googling, I was introduced to new plotting libraries and data representation techniques that I believe I have incorporated in this notebook. The ipynb notebook has some interesting insights that I feel are important during the course of the pandemic.

**Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Kuriankkr/Covid19_Data_Analysis/blob/master/Covid_19%20Analysis.ipynb) to view the notebook. The default github notebook viewer is not compatible all the visualizations that are present in the notebook**

### Data to view the notebook 
The data has been sourced from [Covid-19 Data Repsitory by CSSE at John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The data has been analyzed from **Dec 2019 -- April 2020.** Three subsets of data were used from this repository
- [Confirmed Global Cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)
- [Confirmed Global Deaths](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv)
- [Confirmed Global Recovered Cases](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv)
